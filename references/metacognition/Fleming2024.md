## Takeaways

- In a world of increasingly capable AI systems, self-awareness a.k.a. metacognition remains a human-specific ability.
- AI has a tendency to be overconfident, and humans have a tendency to put too much trust in seemingly performant devices.
- Thanks to psychology and neuroscience research, we are beginning to understand how uncertainty is represented in the brain.
- Researchers are starting to build metacognitive machines (for example, introspective robots).
- Metacognitive metrics such as confidence could be shared between agents (human and autonomous), enhancing mutual understanding.
- Through metacognition, humans could get used to monitoring AI-powered systems they don't understand.
- Application of metacognition to technology could increase the trust and acceptability towards these systems.
