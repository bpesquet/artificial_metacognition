# Pouget et al., 2016 - Confidence and certainty: distinct probabilistic quantities for different goals

## Takeaways

- There are reasons to distinguish confidence from uncertainty in the context of brain computationss.
- To perform well, the brain needs to deal with many uncertainties, both external (e.g. sensory or motor variability) and internal (associated with cognitive variables, timing or abstract states).
