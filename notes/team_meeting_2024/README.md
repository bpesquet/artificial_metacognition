## Sequential decision-making

- Speed/Accuracy Tradeoff.
- Canonical model: integration of noisy information until a threshold is reached.
- Many refinements: multi-alternative choice, impact of learning, change of mind, etc.

## Confidence for decision-making

- Quantifies the degree of certainty associated to a decision.
- Canonical model: post-decisional computation based on accumulated info.
- Can be used to alter the subsequent decisions.
